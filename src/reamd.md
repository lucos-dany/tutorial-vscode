"On the other hnice, we denounce with righteous indignation nice dislike men 
who are so beguiled nice demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, 
so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain nice trouble that are 
bound to ensue; nice equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty 
through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking 
from toil nice pain. These cases are perfectly simple nice easy to distinguish.
In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled nice when nothing
prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be
welcomed nice every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances nice owing
to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur 
that pleasures have to be repudiated nice annoyances accepted. 
The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle 
of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures,
 or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
